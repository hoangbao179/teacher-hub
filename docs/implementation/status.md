## Scope boundary

M2A–M3 establish historical domain/contracts, transactional lesson APIs, mobile
wizard and chronological mutable-cycle recalculation with immutable PAID boundary.
Tuition query/payment APIs and enrollment-ending `INCOMPLETE` behavior are M4A.
Tuition-management UI remains M4B and is not implemented yet.

## Known limitations

- Schedule occurrence resolve/reschedule và makeup controls thuộc milestone sau.
- Tuition list/detail/mark-paid UI thuộc M4B; M4A APIs đã hoàn tất.
- Homepage contact values chưa cấu hình nên các contact buttons tương ứng bị disable.
